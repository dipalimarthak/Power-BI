A. WHERE WE ARE SPENDING LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY


1. CHECK PRICE, STORE
2. VISUALIZE AS BAR GRAPH
3. FOR COLOR REPRESENTATION, DROP STORE TO LEGEND

LEAST COSTCO, SO COSTCO

================== USING POWER QUERY ======================
INPORT PURCHASE OVERVIEW AND PIVOT TABLE
REMOVE 1ST 2 COLUMNS FROM PURCHASE OVERVIEW
TRANSFORM - USER FIRST ROW AS HEADERS
CHANGE DATA TYPE OF 3-6 COLUMNS FROM DECIMAL TO FIX DECIMAL NUMBER
FILTER LOCATION - REMOVE EMPTY
DELETE GRAND TOTAL COLUMN
SELECT ALL 4 DATE COLUMNS AND TRANSPOSE - UNPIVOT COLUMNS
CHANGE DATATYPE COL 3 - DATE
RENAME COL4 - PRUUUDUCT COST
COL 1 - STORE
LOCATION - STORE


PIVOT TABLE-

TRANSFORM - USE 1ST ROW AS HEADERS
SELECT JAN-APR AND UNPIVOT

CLOSE AND APPLY

======================================== Create and Manage Relationships in Power BI ========================================
data file - https://github.com/dipalimarthak/Power-BI/blob/main/Apocolypse%20Food%20Prep%20-%20Relationship%20Tutorial.xlsx

drop in 3 tables - Apocalypse Sales, Apocalypse Store, Customer Information
use cust id-customer id instead of customer-customer to join Apocalypse Sales-Customer Information

cross filter direction - single/both(more accurate)

make relationship active - this will turn the chosen relationship active between the 2 tables

BUILD RELATIONSHIP FROM SCRATCH ------------------

1. DELETE RELATIONSHIP LINKS
2. DRAG CustomerID OVER CUST ID

REPORT TAB

modeling tab - 
COUNT OF SALES = COUNT('Apocolypse Sales'[Order ID])
choose this measure to display
build visual - table - 74
------------
now to see who is buying our product,
under fields, choose Customer
------------
to see which product is selling the best
new measure
sum of Products sold = SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])
check mark this measure, display as table

follow the same for sum of Products sold = SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])
------------

now create new measure
profit_column = (SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - SUM('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) * SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])

project it on a table and add customer to find which customer gives most profit
------------

now copy the measure

under report
home - new column
'profit column' and USE BELOW FORMULA INSTEAD TO FIND INDIVIDUAL ROW RESULTS

profit_column_sumx = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales',('Apocolypse Store'[Price] - 'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])* 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])

------------
DATE FUNCTIONS-


DAY_OF_WEEK = WEEKDAY('Apocolypse Sales'[Date Purchased],2)
2=MONDAY =1

PLOT THIS MEASURE ' DAY OF WEEK' (Y AXIS) AGAINST UNITS SOLD ON  AXIS


COMPARE THIS WIHT EXISTING MEASURES

DATE PURCHASED VS UNITS ORDERED



----------IF STATEMENT------------
NEW COLUMN

====================== Conditional Formatting  ==================
https://github.com/dipalimarthak/Power-BI/blob/main/Apocolypse%20Food%20Prep%20-%20Conditional%20Formatting.xlsx

COLUMNS - PRICE, PRODUCT NAME
RIGHT CLICK PRICE - 
1. BACKGROUND COLOUR

YOU CAN TRY DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON DIFFERENT COBINATION OF COLUMNS

====================== BINS AND LIST ==================
1. APOCALYPSE SALESRIGHT CLICK ON CUSTOMER COLUMN, NEW GROUP
OR FROM FIELDS SECTION

DEFAULT GROUP TYPE - LIST

2. SELECT MULTIPLE VALUES AND THEN GROUP - ASSING A NAME TO THE GROUP
REPEAT THE SAME FOR REMAINING 2 VALUES - ASSING A NAME TO THE GROUP

SO THIS IS MUCH LIKE AN IF STATEMENT AND IS MUCH FASTER


YOU CAN DO WITH NUMERICS ALSO (ORDER ID) - USE LIST, OR AGE - USE BINS, DATE PURCHASED - USE BINS ON MONTHS

---VISUALIZATIONS---
1. AGE(BIN) AND BUYER ID
